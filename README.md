Instructions:
Click on Browse Application to select an executable file. This will allow the Cyber Capture to scan the Exe file directory.
Then Click on the Cyber Capture Directory button to select the path where you want the Cyber Capture to be.
Then Click on Start Cyber Capture this will prompt the software to scan the selected Exe file and it scans for these types of files: virus_patterns = { r'.exe', r'.dll', r'.vbs', r'.ps1', r'.bat', r'.doc', r'.docx', r'.pdf', r'.html', r'.htm', r'.php', r'.js', r'.css', r'.jar', r'.zip', r'.rar', r'.inj', } Note that some EXE files may contain Malicious content that can bypass my Application so please be careful!
Once the cyber Capture is finished doing it's job. It will write two files
1: malicious_pattern ID 0001.txt
2: contents.txt

The Malwicious pattern text file will mark down the types of possible malicious files the exe has And the Contents text file will mark down the binary scripting of the Exe file
Then click on the Dump Binary malware Sripting if you wish to Dump the contents of the Exe file.
Once clicked it will automatically Dump the contents of the Exe file in the same current Cyber Capture

Why Exe Malware Sniffer/Dumper? This is a software I worked with chatgpt. It scans any Executable file for possible virus/malware file types so you wouldn't have to extract the Executable file and cause Malware infections. It also has a feature for dumping the binary contents of every possibly Malicious file type. I will be updating this software every now and then.

Fixed issues and added new things to EXE Malware Sniffer/Dumper V1.0


Fixed and Added:
-Replaced text files with new names
-Removed ID numbering for the Malicious pattern text file

-Added feature where when you click View Cyber Capture you can select a text file to view E.G:

Binary Target.txt  ==  Detected Patterns
Example:
.exe, .zip, .dll, .dll, .dll, .dll,
.dll, .zip, .js, .exe, .js, .js,
.js, .js, .js, .js, .bat, .js,
.js, .html, .doc, .html, .html,
.jar, .jar, .jar, .jar, .zip,

.php, .jar, .jar, .jar, .jar,
.zip, .dll, .dll, .dll, .dll,
.dll, .dll, .dll, .dll, .dll,

Malicious pattern:
Example:
Listing nonduplicate files so listing the same files
as the Bianary Target.txt but the same ones but not duplicate ones

Malicious binary scripting.txt
Example:
Same thing as the Binary target.txt
