# EXE-Malware-Sniffer-Dumper-V1.0
This program I made is a software I made. It scans any Executable file for possible virus/malware file types so you wouldn't have to extract the Executable file and cause Malware infections. It also has a feature for dumping the binary contents of every possibly Malicious file type. I will be updating this software every now and then.
